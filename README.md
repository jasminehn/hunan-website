During my first semester of college, my final project for my Web Design and Image Processing class was to build a fully functional website with a topic and theme of our choosing, while also including the required components of the assignment (animations, dropdown lists, tables, etc). I created a responsive mock website for a local restaurant called Hunan Coventry. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
